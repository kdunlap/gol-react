# Conway's Game of Life

This project is a sample application I used to better learn React and is a work in progress.

Conway's Game of Life is played on a two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells. Each cell can be considered alive or dead. After each turn of the game, the status of each cell can change depending on the status of its 8 neighbors according to the below rules.

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
3. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### Assumptions

- Edges of the board will be considered stitched together, so edge cells will wrap to the opposite edges when checking or alive neighbors
- The starting grid size is fixed for now

### Future Additions

- [x] Have grid edges wrap to the opposite side: "Stitch" the left/right and top/bottom edges together
- [ ] Component Tests
- [ ] Deploy somewhere for demoing
- [ ] Allow grid size to be configured
- [ ] Add TypeScript


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
